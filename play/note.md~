I am on MacOS (Ventura).  When I run this program once, it seems to work.  If I run it again, it complains about memory corruption:
```
package odin2ghp

import "core:os"
import "core:fmt"

main :: proc() {
  fmt.println("--- begin ---")
  m := make(map[string]string);
  m["name"] = "Paul"
  elem,ok := m["name"];
  fmt.println("name=", elem, ok);

  p := &m;
  deref_m := (transmute(^map[string]string)p)^

  fmt.println("--- end");
}
```
(1) What debugger should I use on MacOS?  (I used to be comfortable with gdb on linux).
(2) In the end, I want to pass the map by rawpointer to a function, then deref it and use it like a map.  The code above is only part-way to what I want, but, I can't even get this far...
